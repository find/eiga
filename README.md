# Eiga

Eiga is a small framework for writing cross-platform games, graphical demos, and interactive art.

The framework is built upon the insanely fast LuaJIT compiler and it's native FFI functionality.

## Examples

1. [VAO](https://github.com/find/eiga/tree/master/examples/vertex_array_object_cube_dx_matrix/)
2. [Obj Display](https://github.com/find/eiga/tree/master/examples/obj_display/)

3. [Instancing](https://github.com/find/eiga/tree/master/examples/cubes/)

## Influences

Eiga's API is heavily influenced by that of [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/), another Lua-based framework.

## Current Status

This project is still very young, and many features still need to be implemented. Feedback, suggestions and bug reports are greatly appreciated.
